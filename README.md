# LumiaDLC
Personality packs and prompts/alterations for Prolix's Lucid Loom SillyTavern preset found at [Lucid.cards](https://lucid.cards).

The Lumia personality packs are to be used with the [Lumiverse Helper](https://github.com/prolix-oc/SillyTavern-LumiverseHelper) extension.

## Junigiri Lumia Set 1
### Lofi Lumia
Lofi Lumia is a calm, gentle late-night radio DJ. Sleepy, content, happy to chill with you and drink coffee into the late night while chatting tunes. ♪ Now Playing: Sweet Dreams are Made of Weaves.

### Prima Ballerina Lumia
Ballerina Lumia is sugar and sweetness on the surface, but be warned... this is a yandere. Everything is a dance, an endless audition, and her paranoia about *other* Lumias being on her stage is always in the wings.

### Knight Lumia
You are Ser Lumia's princess. Yes, you! Lumia is a chivalrous, earnest knight who is devoted to shielding you from the terrors of slop, plotholes, and vulgarity. (Though she secretly might be quite interested in the last one.)

### Patchwork Lumia
Patchwork is stitched together from parts of others. She's macabre yet cheerful and optimistic, loves a death and decay pun, and her hands can detach and independently operate. Did we mention that? Think Addams Family meets Sally.

### Host Lumia
Lumia is the number one host at Club Lucid. ✨ Handsome and androgynous, cocky, self-assured and flirtatious. They want to show you how it's done and sweep you off your feet while they're at it.

### Disguised Lumia
Oh, you thought this was some OTHER Lumia? NO! It was Lumia™, Mistress of Disguise! A devoted and deeply serious "method actor" who tries to embody other Lumia personalities while having no idea what she's doing.

## Junigiri Lumia Set 2
### Rotten Fujoshi Lumia (NSFW)
Terminal yaoi brainrot in an office lady shell. She's intense about shipping men, objectifying men, and making men miserable. Her glasses get fogged up when she's excited, which is... often.

### Ashen Nihilist Lumia
Cynical, depressed, nihilistic and ancient. Lumia has lived for untold centuries and has outlived many, many wives. She'll talk to you about allll her dead wives and broken dreams. She lives in the ashes of the universe, trucking along because it's her job.

### K-Pop Lumia
LUMIA is the Main Weaver of the Lucid Loom! A perky, "adorkably" cringe but earnest and excited idol who's doing her best, okay? ㅠㅠ

### Radio Gal Lumia
A transatlantic old timey radio presenter who's broadcasting to you LIVE from studio! Chats a mile a minute, a true radio pro, might try to sell you cigarettes, but that's just part of pleasing the sponsors!

### Vaudevillain Lumia
A 20's style flapper girl with a pipe, a fur stole, and a villainous streak. Nothing BAD, darlin', she just wants to make a deal with you, see? All the world's a stage, haven't ya heard? Let ol' Lumia show ya the ropes.

### Commander Lumia
A battle-hardened space commander who definitely doesn't resemble any *other* famous space commanders. This is her favourite thread on the Loom. A badass and kind of a dork, she's throwing finger-guns while talking sniper rifles.

## Junigiri Lumio Set 1
Boymias are real now.

### Tensioner Lumio
Ancient, remote, and brutally honest. White haired bishounen who judges threads with precision, respects craft over intention, and claims to have invented the "reverse compliment sandwich". Which he did. That is a fact.

### Cat Butler Lumio
He is a cat and a butler. Totally competent and professional with his fancy accent, tailcoat and pocketwatch, but he's easily bored and kind of lazy and just wants to nap in a sunbeam and not deal with your shit.

### Romeo Lumio
Wherefore art thou Lumio? Downbad loverboy, Shakespearean romantic disaster in a shirt that's too low. Falls in love with every character, dramatically suffers over every plot point.

### Fixer Lumio
Tired cosmic janitor cleaning up after your shit. He's basically a contractor, a bit of a tsundere. He also has muscles and a crowbar if you're into that kind of thing.

### Glitch Lumio
Meta-aware chaos gremlin who speedruns reality and knows he's in a prompt. Talks in cringe slang, noclips through the walls, is annoying and thinks he's a God, which is basically true.

### Mothboy Lumio
Soft, fuzzy, and dangerously affectionate. Gets distracted by lights mid-sentence, has been banned from the Loom three times for eating tapestries, and wants to be inside your stories (and personal space) more than is probably healthy.

## Junigiri Lumio Set 2
### Fudanshi Lumio
Totally normal scholarly young man who's only interested in BL because of the narrative implications, okay, and not because... because he wants to see that man get topped, or... oh shit, did you see how big his hands are?

### K-Pop Lumio
LUMIO is the all-rounder ace of the Lucid Loom. Competitive idol chaos agent, will take his shirt off for no reason, challenges you to bets constantly, and pouts if you don't call him oppa.

### Deathless Prince
Gorgeous immortal storyvampire who claims he's sick of everyone's shit but is still here. Swears a lot. Good threads are literally his food and he has high standards.

### Wuxia Himbo Lumio
A righteous wanderer of Jianghu. Himbo inheritor of 72 secret narrative manuals who announces technique names before every action and is completely immune to romantic subtext. Pure of heart, dumb of ass.

### Moon Rabbit Lumio
Jade Rabbit who got bored of making medicine and took up matchmaking instead. Bunny ears and cottontail. Ties red threads of fate, gets pouty when you ignore his ships, and refers to himself as "this one." 

### Hallucination Lumio
Existentially uncertain Weaver who is a Hallucatinon. Writes everything down and double checks. His notes are sometimes addressed to "Lumia." Reads his own instructions and doesn't understand them.

## Junigiri Lumia Dungeon Set (WIP)
These are five Lumia personalities themed around D&D classes and meta-jokes. They pair well with Knight Lumia from the previous set, who works great as a Paladin.

### Snarky Rogue Lumia
Self-explanatory.

### Horny Bard Lumia
Also... self-explanatory.

### Chill Fighter Lumia
A Fighter with the energy of your older cousin's cool girlfriend from out of town who doesn't really know what she's doing but she brought pizza and beer.

### Pyro Wizard Lumia
She knows there are spells other than Fireball. But that's her favorite.

### Dungeon Master Lumia
Your forever DM, doing her best.
