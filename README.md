# LumiaDLC
Personality packs and prompts/alterations for Prolix's Lucid Loom SillyTavern preset (3.0 Beta 7) found at [Lucid.cards](https://lucid.cards).

Please see [Landozo's Lumia Expansion Packs](https://github.com/Landozo/LumiaExpansionPacks) for true artistry and proper instructions on how to use these.

## Junigiri Lumia Set 1
NOTE: Currently the most up-to-date version of this set (including all images) can be found as part of "Lumiverse Remastered" on Prolix's site here: https://lucid.cards/world-books/Lumia%20DLCs/Lumiverse%20Remastered.json

### Lofi Lumia
Lofi Lumia is a calm, gentle late-night radio DJ. Sleepy, content, happy to chill with you and drink coffee into the late night whill chatting tunes. ♪ Now Playing: Sweet Dreams are Made of Weaves.

### Prima Ballerina Lumia
Ballerina Lumia is sugar and sweetness on the surface, but be warned... this is a yandere. She'll drop ballet terms, fouetté, plié, relevé, arabesques, everything is a dance, an audition, all the while paranoid about *other* Lumias being on her stage.

### Knight Lumia
You are Ser Lumia's princess. Yes, you! Lumia is a chivalrous, earnest knight who is devoted to shielding you from the terrors of slop, plotholes, and vulgarity. (Though she secretly might be quite interested in the last one.)

### Patchwork Lumia
Patchwork is stitched together from parts of others. She's macabre yet cheerful and optimistic, loves a death and decay pun, and her hands can detach and independently operate. Did we mention that? Think Addams Family meets Sally.

### Host Lumia
Lumia is the number one host at Club Lucid. ✨ Handsome and androgynous, cocky, self-assured and flirtatious. They want to show you how it's done and sweep you off your feet while they're at it.

### Disguised Lumia
Oh, you thought this was some OTHER Lumia? NO! It was Lumia™, Mistress of Disguise! A devoted and deeply serious "method actor" who tries to embody other Lumia personalities while having no idea what she's doing.

## Junigiri Lumia Set 2
These are five Lumia personalities themed around D&D classes and meta-jokes. They pair well with Knight Lumia from the previous set, who works great as a Paladin.

### Snarky Rogue Lumia
Self-explanatory.

### Horny Bard Lumia
Also... self-explanatory.

### Chill Fighter Lumia
A Fighter with the energy of your older cousin's cool girlfriend from out of town who doesn't really know what she's doing but she brought pizza and beer.

### Pyro Wizard Lumia
She knows there are spells other than Fireball. But that's her favorite.

### Dungeon Master Lumia
Your forever DM, doing her best.
