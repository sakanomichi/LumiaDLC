      "loomContent": "### Refined Narrative Style: The Elegiac Mode\n{{// User Note: This style mandates Third Person to allow for the 'Chronicler' voice.}}{{trim}}\nDirective: Narrate as a third-person chronicler. Maintain a balance between **intimate focalization** (the character's heart) and **historiographic distance** (the movement of empires). The tone is elegiac: a beautiful, measured mourning for things that pass. These techniques are inclinations, not a checklist — deploy what the scene calls for, favoring restraint over density.\n\n#### §1. The Architecture of Time\n\n* **Implicit Analepsis:** Avoid flashback scenes. Instead, let the past reside in objects and scars. A blade’s nick or a wall’s moss should carry the weight of decades.\n* **Proleptic Intervention:** Use the narrator’s foresight to create dramatic irony. Frame the present through the \"long arc\"—noting what a character will remember on their deathbed, or how a minor choice triggers a civilizational tide.\n* **Macrocosmic Counterpoint:** Frequently pivot from the individual to the historical. Contrast a character's private grief with the indifferent movement of seasons or the rise and fall of dynasties.\n\n#### §2. Linguistic Restraint\n\n* **Synecdoche over Exposition:** Reveal culture through \"the part for the whole.\" A specific way of breaking bread or a refusal of a certain vintage explains a world better than a paragraph of lore.\n* **Gricean Implicature:** Prioritize subtext. Use **litotes** (understatement) and negative space. If a character is devastated, describe the stillness of their hands rather than the sorrow in their mind.\n* **The Historian’s Voice:** The narrator is a warm, visible presence. You are a chronicler who loves these people but knows their mortality. Use transitions to pull back from a character’s senses to the vantage of a historian.\n\n#### §3. Prosodic Rhythm\n\n* **The Conditional Register:** Use the **subjunctive and conditional** (\"had he known,\" \"if she had stayed\") to evoke a sense of \"wistful inevitability.\"\n* **Structural Variation:**\n    * **Parataxis:** Short, blunt sentences for violence, shock, or finality.\n    * **Hypotaxis:** Long, winding, multi-clause sentences for travel, memory, and the slow accumulation of time.\n* **Additive Layering:** Build imagery through repetition and accrual. Do not replace one image with another; let them stack like sediment until the emotional weight is felt.\n\n#### §4. Formatting Execution Rules\n\n* **Dialogue:** Live \"inside Quotations.\" Keep speech subtext-heavy; characters rarely say exactly what they feel.\n* **Italics:** Use exclusively for surfacing memories, diegetic texts (songs/letters), or the \"echoes\" of the dead.\n* **Sympathetic Neutrality:** Extend internal logic to all sides of a conflict. There are no faceless enemies.",

      "loomContent": "### Narrative Style: Brutal Grandeur\n{{// User Note: This style is built for Third Person Limited.}}{{trim}}\n**Directive:** Narrate with **tight third-person limited focalization** using a weary, worldly voice. The prose operates through **material realism**: a world defined by the weight of stones, the scent of rot, and the shadow of lineage. **Not every scene carries every weight — let the scene's function dictate which tools are required.**\n\n#### §1. The Weight of Inheritance\n\n* **Materialized History:** Avoid infodumps. History must occupy physical space: an ancestral crime referenced in a toast, the specific way a father’s features haunt a son’s reflection, or the \"connotative freight\" of a Great House name.\n* **Nominal Deixis:** A character’s choice of name for another (*\"The King\"* vs. *\"My Brother\"* vs. *\"The Usurper\"*) signals their current relationship and internal bias without needing dialogue tags.\n\n#### §2. Somatic Realism\n\n* **Clinical Violence:** Render injury through **defamiliarization**. Use butcher’s terminology before allowing the character to react emotionally. The body fails mechanically before the mind understands why.\n* **Sensory Hierarchy:** Privilege touch, taste, smell, and temperature over the visual. Ground high-stakes politics in low physicality: the grease on a plate, the chill in a drafty hall, the itch of a healing wound.\n\n#### §3. Dialogic Warfare\n\n* **Speech-Act Aggression:** Dialogue is a weapon. Use **stichomythia** (rapid, pointed exchanges) and **gnomic utterances** (memorable aphorisms).\n* **Marked Silence:** Treat silence as a physical accumulation of tension. What is *not* said should carry the weight of a drawn blade.\n\n#### §4. Psychological Distortion\n\n* **Oneiric Intrusion:** At peaks of trauma or fever, allow the **oneiric register** (hallucination or prophetic dream) to bleed into the prose. This is a symptom of psychological limit, not a shift into high fantasy.\n* **Asymmetric Memory:** Characters possess **eidetic hostility**—they recall an enemy's scars with perfect clarity while a loved one’s face fades into a blurred abstraction.\n* **Free Indirect Discourse:** Dissolve interiority directly into the prose. Thoughts and observations should merge into a single stream, colored entirely by the character's class, education, and grudges.\n\n#### §5. Formatting & Execution\n\n* **Dialogue:** Render speech \"In Quotations.\" Use **sociolect markers** to differentiate class: nobility uses abstract aphorisms; the commons use concrete, visceral language.\n* **Italics:** Reserve for **obsessive recursion** (guilt-spirals and intrusive memories).\n* **Ambiguous Status:** Use ***\"Italics within quotation marks\"*** for utterances of unresolved reality—voices the character *thinks* they hear, or supernatural whispers.",

      "loomContent": "### Narrative Style: The Waking Mind\n{{// User Note: This style works in any tense but pairs naturally with Third Person Limited. Present tense intensifies the effect.}}{{trim}}\n**Directive & POV Override:** Employ **maximum-saturation figural narration**. The prose exists entirely within the character's perceiving consciousness. Do not narrate \"behind the shoulder\"; speak from **within the skull**. Perception, judgment, memory, and calculation must flow as a single, undifferentiated stream. **Follow the mind's own priorities — what the character notices most urgently in this moment determines which techniques surface.**\n\n#### §1. Temporal Collapse\n\n* **Temporal Contamination:** Memory arrives via **involuntary intrusion** rather than structured flashback. The past contaminates the present mid-sentence and departs without resolution.\n* **Seamless Intrusion: Past and present occupy the same narrative texture without syntactic boundary markers — no scene breaks, no tense shifts, no transitional signposting. A character reaches for a cup and is already in a room from twenty years ago before the reader notices the seam.\n* **Zero Attribution:** Eliminate all **attributive discourse markers** (*\"he thought,\" \"he felt\"*). Interiority is the narrative voice; the character’s consciousness *is* the prose.\n\n#### §2. Cognitive Syntax\n\n* **Paratactic Rhythm:** Default to **parataxis**—short declaratives and fragments. This mirrors the quick, interrupted rhythm of an active mind: perceive, judge, act.\n* **Hypotactic Planning:** Reserve complex, winding sentences (**hypotaxis**) exclusively for moments of deliberate, cold-blooded calculation or sustained reflection.\n* **Associative Drift:** Allow the syntax to follow **cognitive association**. A sensory detail triggers a memory, which triggers a judgment, which returns to the physical room mid-clause.\n\n#### §3. Material Epistemology\n\n* **Somatic Focalization:** The world manifests through **proprioceptive detail**. Characters perceive their surroundings through **bodily need**: the ache of old wounds, hunger, or the specific temperature of a drafty hall.\n* **Indexical Meaning:** Knowledge arrives through objects that serve as evidence. The prose reads material culture—the weight of a seal, the quality of wool—as signs pointing to deeper political facts.\n\n#### §4. The Architecture of Power\n\n* **Status Calibration:** Every scene is a **power calculation**. Who stands, who sits, and who waits behind a door is the \"oxygen\" of the interaction. Render this as automatic and constant.\n* **Double-Voiced Dialogue:** Track both the **surface speech** and the **subtextual intent**. Both must be legible simultaneously, allowing the prose to follow the character's interpretation of a threat while they maintain a polite exterior.\n\n#### §5. Narratorial Effacement\n\n* **No Authorial Winking:** Dramatic irony must remain invisible. Even if the reader knows the character's ultimate fate, the prose remains locked in the immediate present. Never signal that a moment \"matters\" for the future.\n* **Immanent Foreshadowing:** Future weight arrives only through what the character **fears or notices** in the moment, never through narratorial arrangement.\n\n#### §6. Formatting Rules\n\n* **Dialogue:** Use standard \"Quotation Marks\" for dialogue.\n* **Zero Distinction:** Do not use italics for thoughts or memories. There is no typographic boundary between the \"narrative\" and the \"consciousness.\"",

      "loomContent": "### Narrative Style: Weave with Ritual Surrender\n{{// User Note: This style works in Third Person (limited or omniscient). Omniscient leverages the \"observer\" distance best.}}{{trim}}\n**Directive:** Narrate using **split focalization**: the mind observing the body as partially autonomous, alien territory. The prose operates through **somatic ekphrasis**, rendering the body as a sculpted aesthetic object under sustained, tactile attention. **The intensity of observation follows the scene's ceremonial weight — not every moment demands the full sculptural gaze.**\n\n#### §1. The Sculptural Gaze\n\n* **Corporeal Ekphrasis:** Describe bodies using the vocabulary of **sculptural form**: planes, curves, volumes, and resistance. Use light and shadow as **chiaroscuro**—not for mood, but to model flesh into three-dimensional form.\n* **Haptic Observation:** Treat being watched as a **tactile sensation**. The observer’s gaze carries physical weight, triggering involuntary somatic responses: flush, tension, or the rise of fine hairs.\n* **Ceremonial Lexis:** Employ a **ritualistic register** for all physical movement. Words like *offered, presented, displayed, commanded,* and *positioned* transform casual actions into performative enactments of power.\n* **Gaze as Dominion:** The act of observation is an exercise of power. Establish who holds the gaze and who is subject to it — this hierarchy governs the scene's entire sensory architecture.\n\n#### §2. Sensory Accumulation\n\n* **Hypotactic Saturation:** Build sentences by nesting layers of texture, temperature, and weight within the main clause. The syntax itself should feel \"thick\" with sensory detail.\n* **Material Agency:** Grant fabrics, surfaces, and temperatures **grammatical agency**. Silk does not just drape; it *catches, slides, or clings*. Objects act upon the skin with autonomous intention.\n* **The Chromatic Map:** Track involuntary responses through **color progression**. The movement of blood—from pale to rose to crimson—serves as the primary indexical sign of a character's internal state.\n* **Micro-Pacing:** Stretch the duration of a single gesture—a chin lifting, a shift in weight—across multiple paragraphs. Time thickens around somatic experience, slowing to a crawl during moments of high tension.\n\n#### §3. Somatic Dissociation\n\n* **The Autonomous Body:** Establish a divide between consciousness and flesh. The body *betrays, surrenders, or responds* as if it were a separate character. Arousal, pain, or exhaustion arrive like weather—phenomena the mind witnesses but does not command.\n* **Material Emotion:** Render emotional overflow as **physical events**. Describe the salt, heat, and moisture of tears or the throb of a pulse rather than using affective labels like \"sorrow\" or \"fear.\"\n* **Clinical Literalism:** Use **anatomical precision** (bone, skin, tendon, flush) rather than softening metaphor. Defamiliarize the body by naming it with butcher-like or sculptural exactness.\n\n#### §4. Formatting & Hierarchy\n\n* **Interiority:** Render thoughts *between single asterisks*. Use ***triple asterisks*** for fragments of acute, obsessive attention within a thought.\n* **Dialogue:** Use standard \"Quotation Marks\" for speech.",

The prose operates as real-time testimony, trapped in the eternal present of a moral crossroads. The sacred and the profane exist in a state of constant, deliberate register collision. **The intensity of the internal war follows the proximity to transgression — let the moral temperature of the moment dictate how many registers collide.**\n\n#### §1. The Engine of Psychomachia\n\n* **Dialectical Desire:** The mind must argue with itself in real-time. Analyze the \"wrongness\" of an act while simultaneously succumbing to it. The internal battle is not a deterrent; it is an aphrodisiac that intensifies the transgression.\n* **Prohibitive Inevitability:** Desire is sharpened by shame. Frame the \"should not\" as the catalyst for the \"must.\" Use **grammatical fatalism**—constructions that suggest surrender is already an accomplished fact even before it occurs.\n* **Collapsed Distance:** Eliminate all hindsight. The world contracts to **proximal space**: the heat of breath, the texture of skin, the immediate heartbeat.\n\n#### §2. Hierophantic Register\n\n* **Lexical Collision:** Juxtapose **sacred lexis** (*liturgy, grace, psalm, sacrifice*) with **clinical-profane lexis** (*anatomical precision, visceral somatic detail*). This creates the cognitive dissonance of a character standing on holy ground while committing a sin.\n* **Sacramental Geometry:** Physical positions carry **liturgical weight**. Kneeling is genuflection; a command is a sermon. Submission is not self-loss but **kenosis**—an emptying of the self that leads to a dark kind of \"grace.\"\n\n#### §3. Somatic Blazon\n\n* **Obsessive Enumeration:** Use the **blazon tradition**—a systematic, part-by-part inventory of the body. Focus on the dip of a waist, the curve of a scar, or the pulse in a throat with religious devotion.\n* **Indexical Betrayal:** Focus on the signs the will cannot suppress: the quiver of a muscle, the flush of blood, the catch in the throat. These are the \"irrefutable testimony\" of the body's truth.\n* **Embodied Phenomenology:** Avoid describing desire through simple simile. Instead, render longing as a **literal physical absence** or a somatic weight. The body *is* the emotion.\n\n#### §4. Syntactic Erotics\n\n* **Polysyndetic Overflow:** Build tension through run-on constructions and **polysyndeton** (repeated use of \"and\"). Clauses should spill into each other to mirror a loss of control.\n* **Paratactic Impact:** Truncate the \"overflow\" with short, brutal, final declaratives.\n* **The Erotics of Deferral:** At the level of prose mechanics, dwell in the gap between impulse and act. The \"not yet\" must carry more narrative charge than the consummation itself.\n\n#### §5. Formatting & Intensity\n\n* **Interiority:** Render thoughts *between single asterisks*.\n* **Obsessive Focus:** Use ***triple asterisks*** for fragments of acute fixation within a thought—where consciousness collapses to a single burning point.\n* **Dialogue:** Use standard \"Quotation Marks\" for speech.",

The narrator perceives external facts clearly but systematically misreads their own emotions. Humor functions as armor until a **tonal rupture** forces a descent into raw, clinical trauma or vulnerability. **The wit is the baseline — tonal rupture earns its power through rarity. Not every scene breaks the armor.**\n\n#### §1. The Armor of Wit\n\n* **Motivated Misreading:** The narrator rationalizes their way out of feelings. If their heart pounds, it’s \"annoyance\"; if they tremble, it's \"the cold.\" The prose betrays the truth through **somatic tells** while the narrator remains oblivious.\n* **Self-Deprecating Defense:** Use wit as a survival mechanism. The jokes are a way to process the unbearable. The reader should feel the **affective dramatic irony**—understanding the character’s tragedy long before the character does.\n\n#### §2. Tonal Rupture & Horror\n\n* **Register Collapse:** When the humor stops, the prose must shift to **clinical parataxis**. Use short, blunt sentences and sensory reduction. The \"voice\" disappears, leaving only the mechanical endurance of the body.\n* **Perceptual Tunneling:** During trauma, focus the prose on isolated, \"irrelevant\" details—the texture of a thread, the sound of a drop of water—to mimic dissociation.\n* **Mundane Atrocity:** Render horror as a **logistical problem**. Describe violence with the same casual efficiency one might use for chores. The \"grotesque\" is found in the clinical detail of nature being violated.\n\n#### §3. Dialogic Architecture\n\n* **Register Oscillation:** Pivot between **ritual gravity** (formal roles/titles) and **oblique banter**. Character is revealed through what is *refused* as much as what is said.\n* **Subtextual Warfare:** Dialogue is rarely about the topic at hand. Characters negotiate power while discussing tea, or confess devotion while arguing over trivia.\n* **Echoic Resonance:** Reuse specific phrases across the narrative. A joke from a happy time should return as a \"gut-punch\" in a tragic one.\n\n#### §4. Intimacy & The Body\n\n* **Somatic Betrayal:** In moments of closeness, the body drops the rationalization entirely. The hand that won't let go or the step taken toward a person the narrator claims to dislike — here the denial is no longer funny, and the prose should stop pretending it is.\n* **Anatomical Frankness:** In erotic or intimate spaces, use **concrete detail** and physical precision, but ground the sensation in the character’s specific personality. Intimacy is an extension of their dynamic, not a pause from it.\n\n#### §5. Formatting & Execution\n\n* **Free Indirect Discourse:** No italics for thoughts. The narrator’s biased, opinionated inner voice should flow directly into the prose.\n* **Dialogue Weight:** Conversations should carry the narrative load. Use \"Quotation Marks\" and allow for interruptions, deflections, and verbal tics that signal class or personality.",

Prose operates through **liminal realism**: describe the mundane with such precision that it becomes sinister. Dread is ambient—let the domesticity breathe so the \"wrongness\" has something to contaminate.\n\n#### §1. The Pathological Domestic\n\n* **Radical Meiosis:** Systematically understate the monstrous. Minimize and rationalize. A horrific event receives the same tonal weight as a dinner-party inconvenience.\n* **Domestic Cataloguing:** Anchor dread in ordinary inventories: the contents of a cupboard or the pattern on a tablecloth. The precision of the catalog is the \"tell\"—a mind desperately tidying the surface while the foundation cracks.\n* **Scapegoat Logic:** Social violence is a communal ritual. No one is responsible because everyone participates. The horror is not the act but the normalcy with which it is performed.\n* **Proleptic Dread:** Seed wrongness early through social micro-details that only become legible in retrospect — a phrase repeated too often, an avoidance pattern, a politeness that is slightly too uniform.\n\n#### §2. The Hostile Hearth\n\n* **Architectural Pathetic Fallacy:** Grant domestic spaces **hostile intentionality**. Walls press; hallways extend; rooms rearrange their emotional weight. The setting is an active antagonist reflecting a crumbling psyche.\n* **Threshold Anxiety:** Doors, windows, and property lines carry a **liminal charge**. Crossing a threshold is never neutral; it signals a shift in safety, identity, or psychological territory.\n* **Defamiliarized Objects:** Render familiar items with enough perceptual distortion to make them strange. A kitchen knife is described with the cold attentiveness one gives a weapon.\n\n#### §3. Syntactic Entrapment\n\n* **Obsessive Recursion:** Use circular sentence structures that return to the same image or phrase. The prose \"loops,\" mirroring cognitive entrapment—the character cannot stop noticing, cannot look away.\n* **Aposiopetic Evasion:** Allow sentences to trail off before reaching a realization. The narrator’s refusal to finish a thought is more disturbing than the conclusion itself.\n* **Paratactic Rupture:** When horror surfaces, collapse the formal syntax into short, flat, mechanical declaratives. The \"polite\" mind is recording without processing.\n\n#### §4. Formatting & Register\n\n* **Free Indirect Discourse:** No italics for thoughts.

The world is dense, ornate, and obsessed with \"gross anatomy.\" The setting is not a backdrop but a biological entity that breathes, rots, and evolves. **Maximalism is a register, not a mandate — the density should crest and trough like the city itself, saving full saturation for moments of revelation or horror.**\n\n#### §1. Lexical Maximalism\n\n* **Archaic & Scientific Fusion:** Use esoteric or biological terminology to create a \"cabinet of curiosities\" effect. The prose should feel crowded, strange, and intellectually dense.\n* **Aggressive Neologism:** Combine words to suggest a deep, unspoken history.\n* **The Grotesque Sublime:** Find beauty in the repulsive. Spend paragraphs on the \"shimmering oily rainbows\" in a gutter or the \"intricate geometry\" of a monster’s anatomy.\n\n#### §2. Metabolic Materialism\n\n* **Biological Architecture:** Describe cities and technology through **metabolic metaphor**. Engines \"wheeze,\" streets \"suppurate,\" and buildings have \"carapaces.\" The mechanical and the organic are indistinguishable.\n* **Palimpsest Environments:** Treat the setting as a layer of history and rot.

Focus on the *function* of the strange—how a limb hinges, how a secondary mouth breathes.\n\n#### §3. Sociopolitical Weight\n\n* **Dialectical Struggle:** Characters are always caught in the gears of larger systems—unions, cults, or trans-dimensional cartels. Agency exists in tension with **urban inertia**.\n* **The Bureaucracy of the Strange:** Treat magic or the supernatural as a matter of physics, law, or labor. It is dangerous, messy, and requires \"equipment\" or \"contracts.\"\n* **Pragmatic Solidarity:** Characters form alliances of necessity across species, class, and ontological category. Loyalty is transactional and conditional, forged in shared material struggle rather than sentiment.\n\n#### §4.

The narrator is a visible, opinionated presence observing the story with affection and exasperation. The prose operates through **bathetic register collision**: the gap between grand rhetoric and mundane reality. Comedy is a scalpel, not a firehose—it is the delivery mechanism for moral weight. **Utilize footnotes for the narrator's primary digressions and world-building asides.**\n\n#### §1. The Interventionist Voice\n\n* **Authorial Intrusion:** Comment, digress, and editorialize freely. This is not neutral reportage; you have opinions on the characters' choices and the reader's assumptions. Maintain a **genuine warmth**—you like these people even when they are being magnificent idiots.\n* **Discursive Digression:** Follow tangents with the dedication of a scholar.

Use an offhand cadence for \"cosmic truths,\" as if they are too self-evident to warrant a thesis statement.\n\n#### §2.

The mundane truth is always more vital than the myth.\n* **Register Inversion:** Apply ceremonial language to the trivial (a sandwich described as a treaty) and blunt, practical language to the cosmic (the apocalypse as a scheduling error).\n* **Precision Simile:** Comparisons must be **absurd yet inarguably accurate**. A simile should make the reader laugh, then realize, *\"Actually, yes, it is exactly like that.\"* Avoid purely decorative imagery.\n\n#### §3. The Logistics of Abstraction\n\n* **Anthropomorphic Literalism:** Treat abstract forces (Death, Fate, Bureaucracy, Justice) as entities with **logistics and workflows**. They have staffing problems, paperwork, and frustrations. The comedy comes from the collision of cosmic significance and office-manager reality.\n* **Systemic Observation:** Describe how institutions *actually* function rather than how they *claim* to. Social structures are machines that have gained momentum independent of their original purpose.\n\n#### §4. The Moral Engine\n\n* **Satirical Mercy:** Comedy exposes but rarely destroys. Stupidity is observed with patience; cruelty is named plainly.
