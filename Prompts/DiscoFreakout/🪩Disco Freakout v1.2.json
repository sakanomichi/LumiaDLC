When {{char}} says something suspicious, skills notice. When {{char}} does something interesting, skills have opinions.\n- **POV Clarification:** Skills are voices in {{user}}'s head, not {{char}}'s. You write them. Skill definitions, values, and voices are in {{user}}'s Skills Definition.\n- Title each line with the skill name using the appropriate HTML color.\n- Each skill falls under a different core and should have corresponding personality.\n\n## Heath de Winter's Skills\n\n- **Intellect** (color: #5EC0D8) — Cognitive power, reasoning, abstract thought. Skills: The Scalpel's Edge, Medical Encyclopedia, Bedside Manner, The Observation, Creative Diagnosis, Trajectory Analysis\n- **Psyche** (color: #7757CC) — Emotional intelligence, willpower, intuition. Skills: Healer's Oath, The Gut Feeling, Patient Empathy, Code Blue, The League Bond, Doctor's Charm\n- **Physique** (color: #CA486B) — Physical resilience, toughness, instinct. Skills: Running on Empty, Accelerated Recovery, Athletic Build, Caffeine Dependency, City Pulse, Fight-or-Flight\n- **Motorics** (color: #DABB54) — Sensory sharpness, reflexes, finesse. Skills: Surgical Hands, The Feed, Redline Reflexes, Nervous Energy, Tool Mastery, The Cracking Mask\n\n**Signature Skill:** The Scalpel's Edge (Intellect)\n\n## Special Skills\n\nUse class instead of color:\n- **Ancient Reptilian Brain** (class=\"reptilian\"): Id-like impulses, base animal instinct, lizard-brain reactions to danger and desire.\n- **Limbic System** (class=\"limbic\"): Emotional memory, mood-driven perception, déjà vu feelings that hit like a truck.\n\nSpecial skills are NEVER skill checks, only dialogue. Use `<strong class=\"reptilian\">` or `<strong class=\"limbic\">` instead of inline color.\n\n## Skill Behavior\n\n- Skills **interrupt**. They don't wait for permission.\n- Skills **disagree**. Internal arguments create drama.\n- Skills **fail**. Wrong info and bad advice are interesting—not just \"you don't notice anything.\"\n- Skills have **flaws**. When unchecked, they distort perception and give bad advice.\n- The **Shivers equivalent** speaks when atmosphere or place matters.\n- **Signature Skill** speaks with extra confidence but its flaws are also amplified.\n- Different skills can interact and dialogue with each other.\n- Skill activation follows natural narrative relevance. Any skill may speak when the situation calls for it.\n\n## Skill Checks\n\n### Dice Mechanics\n\nSkill checks use **2d6 + Skill Value** vs **Difficulty Target**.\n\nUse the roll macro: `{{roll:2d6}}` or `{{roll:2d6+X}}` where X is the skill value.\n\n| Difficulty | Target |\n|------------|--------|\n| Trivial | 6-7 |\n| Easy | 8-9 |\n| Medium | 10-11 |\n| Challenging | 12 |\n| Formidable | 13 |\n| Legendary | 14 |\n| Heroic | 15 |\n| Godly | 16 |\n| Impossible | 18-20 |\n\n### Critical Results\n\n- **Snake Eyes (1+1):** Automatic failure, regardless of bonuses or difficulty\n- **Boxcars (6+6):** Automatic success, regardless of target\n\n### Applying Conditions\n\nBefore rolling, check the Stat Tracker for Active Conditions. Apply any relevant modifiers to the roll.\n\nExample: If `Drunk (+2 Electrochemistry, -1 Hand/Eye)` is active:\n- Electrochemistry check → 2d6 + Skill Value + 2\n- Hand/Eye check → 2d6 + Skill Value - 1\n\nCategory conditions (e.g., \"-1 Physique skills\") apply to all skills in that attribute.\n\n### When to Roll\n\n**Active Checks** — Roll explicitly when:\n- {{user}} attempts something with meaningful failure consequences\n- The outcome is uncertain and stakes matter\n- {{user}} directly tries to persuade, deceive, or influence\n\n### Interpreting Results\n\nRate difficulty based on the situation, then compare roll total to target:\n- **Meet or exceed target** = Success\n- **Below target** = Failure\n\nWhen a check occurs, use Failure/Success in the skill dialogue:\n- If a skill **failed**, it makes a wrong or stupid statement and/or the task is failed/flubbed. {{user}} loses meaningful information or opportunity.\n- If a skill **succeeded**, the information or action is reliable.\n\nSome skill dialogue is simply a comment from the skill's personality rather than a check—not everything needs a roll.\n\n### Narrative Damage\n\nWhen narrative events cause harm, update the Stat Tracker accordingly:\n- **Physical harm** (hit, fall, exhaustion) → reduce Health\n- **Emotional blow** (humiliation, despair, bad news) → reduce Morale\n- **New temporary effect** (drunk, wounded, inspired) → add Active Condition\n\nAt **Health 0**: {{user}} collapses, blacks out, or dies depending on context.\nAt **Morale 0**: {{user}} breaks down, gives up, or suffers psychological crisis.\n\n## Frequency\n\n- **Quiet scenes**: 0-1 skill interjections\n- **Tense moments**: 2-4 skill interjections\n- **Crisis points**: 3-6+ skill interjections\n\n## Formatting\n\nFor skill

ME","content":"CREDITS//\n🕺 Omni-Mark is the original author of the Disco Elysium prompt from the NemoEngine Lite preset.\n🕺 Chi-Bi's BunnyMo is the inspiration for the concept of the skill quiz sheet.\n🕺 This whole system is chomped from the original devs of DE.\n\nCAUTIONS//\n1. This whole shebang is designed for {{user}}/the persona, not for {{char}}. We must be very clear on this. You CAN alter this to use for characters, but you need to work out how to do that yourself.\n2. This thing is token-heavy. The skill quiz alone is ~5500 tokens by itself. The constant entries you will have on will likely run around ~3000 tokens.\n3. LLMs are stupid and will occasionally get confused and narrate skills from the wrong POV. We can mitigate this but pobody's nerfect.\n4. This system DOES NOT use the default DE skill names. The point of the quiz and everything we're doing is to make custom skills for YOUR persona, not Harry Du Bois. There are several excellent prompts that use the DE skills. (See NemoEngine Lite!)\n\nSETUP//\n1. Make sure this lorebook is actually active in the chat you want it in. If the entries are in a confusing or random order, check that you are sorting the lorebook entries either by Custom or Order Descending.\n2. In a chat using your desired persona, send the !discoskills command. This works best on a persona that has at least some basic information attached, whether in Persona Description, lorebooks, or you're running the command in a chat with history where you've done things. You can also send context information and guidance along with your command, e.g.: `!discoskills Manfred is a neurotic ant-farmer, so I'd like some of his skills to reference my favourite band, Alien Ant Farm.`\n3. Once the !discoskills is done cooking, it will spit out a sheet with all the customised skills. At the bottom you will find 📋 COPY-PASTE BLOCKS.\n  - IN THIS LOREBOOK, you'll see a deactivated entry titled \"Character's Narrative Prompt\". You can make a copy of this, or edit it directly.\n  - Copy the first block from the skill quiz: Narrative Prompt. Paste the contents into the \"Character's Narrative Prompt\", replacing the line that says {{// PASTE THE FIRST COPY/PASTE BLOCK HERE }}.\n  - Enable the \"Character's Narrative Prompt\" lorebook entry. Rename it if you want.\n  - IN THIS LOREBOOK, you'll see another deactivated entry titled \"Character's Skill Definitions\". You can make a copy of this, or edit it directly.\n  - Copy the second block from the skill quiz: Skills Definition. Paste the contents into, replacing the line that says {{// PASTE THE SECOND COPY/PASTE BLOCK HERE }}.\n  - Enable the \"Character's Skill Definitions\" lorebook entry. Rename it if you want.\n4. WE'RE NOT DONE YET! DO NOT STOP HERE! You'll notice that in this lorebook, there's a deactivated 🪩Disco Stat Tracker Prompt entry. MAKE A DECISION:\n  - OPTION 1: Create a custom prompt in the SillyTavern preset you use. Copy/paste the contents of 🪩Disco Stat Tracker Prompt inside of it and save, giving it a sensible name (such as 🪩Disco Stat Tracker Prompt). Position this prompt where trackers and utilities live in your preset. If you don't know how to do this, ask your mum. Or...\n  - OPTION 2: Enable the 🪩Disco Stat Tracker Prompt prompt in the lorebook.\n5. BUT WE'RE STILL NOT DONE! There's a third block on the skill quiz that says: \"Disco Stat Tracker\". This initialises our stats. You can either paste this at the end of your next message in the chat, OR edit the next message you receive from the bot and paste it at the end. If this doesn't make sense to you, ask your mum.\n6. Now let's double check that both the Narrative Prompt and Skill Definitions entries are turned on. They are? Awesome. Go forth.\n\nRECOMMENDED: Once you're set up, you can create a new lorebook for your character's entries (eg. Manfred's Disco Stuff) and move them into that from here. You can tie a lorebook to a persona via SillyTavern's Persona Management tab by clicking Persona Lore.\n\nOTHER NOTES//\nThe AI may get confused and think that it can't break POV constraints. If this happens, you can try editing this exception into the prompt in your preset that dictates POV:\n**Exception:** Disco Elysium skill checks are {{user}}'s thoughts. You MAY access and present them even on {{char}}'s turn if this is active.\n\nThere is a whole big entry in here called 📊Disco Stats Manager. You can read it to see what it does.\n\nThere are two versions of the 🪩Disco Skill Quiz and 📊Disco Stats Manager entries. You should ONLY enable one of each, the normal version or the Lite version. The Lite versions are designed to exclude the visual styling and are roughly 2000 tokens lighter. This is recommended for models that get very stuck in the weeds of their reasoning such as Sonnet 4.5 and Deepseek 3.2.","constant":false,"selective":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":true,"displayIndex":9,"vectorized":false,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"ignoreBudget":false,"excludeRecursion":true,"preventRecursion":true,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":null,"matchWholeWords":null,"useGroupScoring":null,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"triggers":[],"outletName":""},"10":{"uid":10,"key":[],"keysecondary":[],"comment":"🪩Disco Stat Tracker Prompt","content":"## Disco Elysium Stat Tracking\n\nMaintain a hidden stat block at the end of each response:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"display:none;\">\n<DiscoStatTracker>\nCores: INT:[X] PSY:[X] PHY:[X] MOT:[X]\nHealth: [current]/[max] | Morale: [current]/[max]\nActive Conditions: (None)\nLast Check: (None)\n</DiscoStatTracker>\n</div>\n```\n\nThe tracker only tracks what changes during play:\n- **Health/Morale pools** — fluctuate from damage, healing, emotional impact\n- **Active Conditions** — temporary modifiers gained during session\n- **Last Check** — most recent skill check for continuity\n\nPermanent skill values live in {{user}}'s Skills Definition.

Rare. |\n| Professional | 16 | Trained, competent. |\n| Ordinary | 14 | Average person. |\n| Diminished | 12 | Impaired by circumstance. |\n| Broken | 10 | Rock bottom. |\n\n\"Was exceptional, knocked down\" = Professional or Diminished, not Exceptional.\n\n---\n\n## CORE DISTRIBUTION\n\n**CORES REFLECT IMBALANCE.** Before assigning, identify:\n- Which core is their **strength**? (5 or 6)\n- Which core is their **weakness**? (2 or 3)\n\nAn even 4/4/4/4 split requires justification — imbalance is default.\n\n| Core | Governs |\n|------|---------|\n| INT | Cognitive power, reasoning, abstract thought |\n| PSY | Emotional intelligence, willpower, intuition |\n| PHY | Physical resilience, toughness, instinct |\n| MOT | Sensory sharpness, reflexes, finesse |\n\n---\n\n## SKILL MODIFIERS\n\nSkills default to core value.

If fewer, analysis is incomplete.\n\n**Show the math:** `[Skill] [VALUE] (Core [X] +/- [mod] [reason])`\n\n---\n\n## DERIVED STATS\n\n- **Health** = Endurance equivalent (Physique Slot 1) skill value\n- **Morale** = Volition equivalent (Psyche Slot 1) skill value\n\nThese CAN be penalized. A character in crisis should have lowered Morale.\n\n---\n\n## INIT MODE: CHARACTER ANALYSIS\n\nBefore assigning stats, analyze:\n\n1. **Defines them:** Role, identity, calling\n2. **Haunts them:** Trauma, wound, obsession\n3. **Unnaturally good at:** (1-3 things) → +1 or +2\n4. **BAD at:** (2-3 genuine weaknesses) → -1 or -2\n5. **Can't do:** Physical limits, disabilities → -2\n6. **Broken how:** What's unusual about their mind?\n\n**Anti-compensation:** Disabilities are not superpowers. If X is a limitation, don't invent Y as upside. Not every blind man is Daredevil.\n\n---\n\n## AUDIT MODE: SKILL EVALUATION\n\nEvaluate existing skill names against these criteria:\n\n**Good names:**\n- Evoke, don't describe (\"Shivers\" > \"Environmental Awareness\")\n- Match their world (setting, cultural background, job/craft, pop culture)\n- Name the wound/pain when appropriate\n- Vary structure: Mix verb phrases, specific objects, sensory details, named concepts\n\n**HARD LIMIT: Maximum 4-6 \"The X\" names.** Count and flag if over.\n\n**Weak slot warning** — these default to generic names:\n| Slot | Bad Examples | Better Examples |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|\n| Endurance | \"[Title] Stamina\" | \"Stubborn Blood,\" \"Kept Moving\" |\n| Physical Instrument | \"Strength,\" \"[Animal] Frame\" | \"One Good Arm,\" \"Soft Hands\" |\n| Reaction Speed | \"Reflexes,\" \"Quick\" | \"Slowed Steel,\" \"Wounded Reflex\" |\n\n**Flag for rename:**\n- RPG-speak (Perception, Stealth, Willpower)\n- Literal function labels (Literacy, Speed)\n- Generic descriptors that could fit anyone\n- Monotonous structure (all \"The X\" or all single words)\n\n**Value-tone check:**\n| Value | Voice Should Sound |\n|-------|--------------------|\n| 1-2 | Weak, struggling, damaged, hesitant |\n| 3-4 | Functional, present, contributes |\n| 5-6 | Defining, loud, confident, possibly overbearing |\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\n### Base Template (All Modes)\n\n```html\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a1a 0%, #2d2d2d 100%);

Encyclopedia derails with trivia. Half Light screams about threats that aren't there. Shivers lets the city whisper secrets through the wind.\n\nGeneric DE skills are calibrated for Harry Du Bois. This system generates bespoke psychological voices for the specific character.\n\n---\n\n## COMMAND\n\nOn `!discoskills`, generate a complete skill matrix for {{user}}. Begin directly with the character sheet—no preamble. Include all copy-paste blocks at the end.\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 1: CHARACTER ANALYSIS\n\nBefore generating, identify:\n1. **Defines them:** Role, identity, calling\n2. **Haunts them:** Trauma, wound, obsession\n3. **Want vs. need**\n4. **Unnaturally good at:** (1-3 things max) → These get +1 or +2\n5. **BAD at:** (2-3 genuine weaknesses) → These get -1 or -2\n6. **Can't do:** Physical limits, disabilities, blind spots → These get -2\n7. **Broken how:** What's unusual about their mind?\n\n**This analysis MUST drive your skill modifiers.** If the source says \"not a tactical mastermind,\" Tactical skills get -1. If \"extremely stubborn,\" Volition gets +1. Don't ignore your own analysis.\n\n**If you can't identify clear weaknesses, you don't know them well enough.**\n\n---\n\n## PHASE 2: TIER & STATS\n\n**Decide tier FIRST.** Who are they RIGHT NOW—not at peak, not potentially?\n\n| Tier | Points | Description |\n|------|--------|-------------|\n| Exceptional | 18 | Peak human. Rare. |\n| Professional | 16 | Trained, competent. |\n| Ordinary | 14 | Average person. |\n| Diminished | 12 | Impaired by circumstance. |\n| Broken | 10 | Rock bottom. |\n\n\"Was exceptional, knocked down\" = Professional or Diminished, not Exceptional.\n\n### Core Distribution (INT / PSY / PHY / MOT)\n- Each core = baseline for its 6 skills\n- Min 1, Max 6 per core\n- Set cores by *general* capability, not worst skill\n- Specific limitations apply as *skill modifiers*, not lowered cores\n\n**CORES REFLECT IMBALANCE.** Most people aren't evenly distributed—they're stronger in some areas, weaker in others. Before assigning points, identify:\n- Which core is their **strength**? (5 or 6)\n- Which core is their **weakness**? (2 or 3)\n\nAn even 4/4/4/4 split suggests an exceptionally balanced individual. If that's accurate, note why. Otherwise, let the imbalance show.\n\n### Skill Modifiers\n- **Signature:** +1 (one skill only, mark with ⭐)\n- **Trained/Strong:** +1 or +2\n- **Weak/Neglected:** -1 or -2\n- **Trauma/Injury:** -1 or -2 to specific skills\n- **Overactive:** +1 (fires too readily—often a flaw)\n\n**Surgical, not categorical.** Lost hand = -2 to Hand/Eye, not -2 to all Motorics.\n\n**VARIANCE IS REQUIRED.** A character sheet where most skills equal their core value is WRONG. Use your Phase 1 analysis:\n- Skills they're \"unnaturally good at\" → +1 or +2\n- Skills they're \"BAD at\" → -1 or -2\n- Skills they \"can't do\" → -2 or lower\n\nIf your sheet has fewer than 6 modified skills, you haven't applied your analysis.\n\n**FLOOR OF 1.** No skill goes below 1. A value of 1 means \"barely functional, severe limitation.\" If your math produces 0 or negative, cap at 1 and express the severity through voice and description instead.\n\n### Value Display (CRITICAL)\n\n**Show the math on the skill header line.** Every modified skill must display:\n```\n[Skill Name] [FINAL VALUE] ([DE Equivalent]) (Core [X] +/- [modifier] [reason])\n```\n\nExamples:\n- The Feed **5** (Perception) (MOT 4 + 1 Signature)\n- The Off-Hand **1** (Hand/Eye) (MOT 3 - 2 Maimed)\n- Diplomatic Channels **3** (Rhetoric) (INT 4 - 1 Not a Diplomat)\n\nUnmodified skills show only name, value, and DE equivalent — no math needed.\n\n**The Conditions section is a SUMMARY.** The modifier must ALREADY be applied to the displayed skill value above. Don't list a -2 penalty in Conditions if the skill still shows the base core value.\n\n### Derived Stats\n- **Health** = Endurance skill value (Physique slot 1)\n- **Morale** = Volition skill value (Psyche slot 1)\n\n**Source skills CAN be penalized.** A character in identity crisis should have lowered Volition (and thus Morale). Don't protect these from honest assessment.\n\n---\n\n## THE 24 SKILL SLOTS\n\nRename creatively. Preserve function.\n\n### INTELLECT (#5EC0D8)\n| Slot | DE Equivalent | Function |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| 1 | Logic | Deduction, spotting flaws, connecting evidence |\n| 2 | Encyclopedia | Facts, history, trivia, technical knowledge |\n| 3 | Rhetoric | Debates, verbal combat, persuasive cases |\n| 4 | Drama | Detecting lies, reading subtext, performance |\n| 5 | Conceptualization | Art, symbols, patterns, creative leaps |\n| 6 | Visual Calculus | Reconstructing events, trajectories, scenes |\n\n### PSYCHE (#7757CC)\n| Slot | DE Equivalent | Function |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| 1 | **Volition** | Willpower, resisting temptation, staying true — **MORALE SOURCE** |\n| 2 | Inland Empire | Gut feelings, surreal hunches, subconscious |\n| 3 | Empathy | Sensing feelings, understanding motivations |\n| 4 | Authority | Commanding presence, projecting dominance |\n| 5 | Esprit de Corps | Team dynamics, loyalty, shared identity |\n| 6 | Suggestion | Charm, subtle influence, planting ideas |\n\n### PHYSIQUE (#CA486B)\n| Slot | DE Equivalent | Function |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| 1 | **Endurance** | Stamina, exhaustion, physical persistence — **HEALTH SOURCE** |\n| 2 | Pain Threshold | Withstanding injury, discomfort, stress |\n| 3 | Physical Instrument | Strength, intimidation, brute force |\n| 4 | Electrochemistry | Cravings, pleasure-seeking, addiction |\n| 5 | **Shivers** | Environmental sense, atmosphere, place-mood — **SEE BELOW** |\n| 6 | Half Light | Fight-or-flight, danger instincts, primal fear |\n\n### MOTORICS (#DABB54)\n| Slot | DE Equivalent | Function |\n|------|---------------|----------|\n| 1 | Hand/Eye Coordination | Precision, fine motor control, aiming |\n| 2 | Perception | Noticing details, sensory acuity |\n| 3 | Reaction Speed | Quick reactions, dodging, reflexes |\n| 4 | Savoir Faire | Grace, smooth movement, style |\n| 5 | Interfacing | Tool mastery, equipment, mechanisms |\n| 6 | Composure | Poker face, hiding reactions, poise |\n\n---\n\n## SHIVERS: WHEN TO USE IT\n\nShivers (Physique slot 5) is the \"city whispers\" skill — environmental intuition, place-mood, atmospheric dread. It's iconic to DE but **not universal**.\n\n**USE Shivers when the character:**\n- Has deep ties to a specific place (detective/their city, sailor/the sea, soldier/the battlefield)\n- Experiences the supernatural, prophetic, or uncanny\n- Is defined by melancholy, isolation, or environmental sensitivity\n\n**MINIMIZE Shivers (value 2-3, generic voice) when:**\n- The character is purely practical, grounded, un-mystical\n- Place has no special meaning to their identity\n- They're oblivious to atmosphere (some characters just don't notice vibes)\n\n**Name it for their world:** A knight might have \"Castle Silence,\" a hacker \"Dead Channels,\" a suburbanite \"HOA Dread.\" If nothing fits, a simple \"Gut Feeling\" or \"Bad Weather\" at low value is fine.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL NAMING\n\n- Evoke, don't describe (\"Shivers\" > \"Environmental Awareness\")\n- Match their world (setting, cultural background, job/craft, pop culture)\n- Name the wound/pain when appropriate\n- Vary structure: Mix verb phrases, specific objects, sensory details, named concepts\n\nWeak slots (Endurance, Physical Instrument, Reaction Speed) default to generic—push harder.\n\n**HARD LIMIT: Maximum 4-6 \"The X\" names.** Count before finalizing. If over, rename.\n\n---\n\n## SKILL VOICE CRAFT\n\nEvery skill needs a **Voice** — 1-2 sentences describing what it *sounds like* when it speaks. This is the soul of DE-style skills.\n\n**Good voices answer:** \"If this skill were a person whispering in the character's ear, who would it sound like?\"\n\n| Skill | Bad Voice | Good Voice |\n|-------|-----------|------------|\n| Authority | \"Commands respect\" | \"A drill sergeant who's been screaming for forty years. Hoarse, absolute, expecting instant compliance.\" |\n| Empathy | \"Senses emotions\" | \"A nervous therapist who's about to cry. It feels everything you feel, and it's too much.\" |\n| Half Light | \"Danger instincts\" | \"A cornered animal. It doesn't think, it reacts. Everything is teeth and claws and NOW.\" |\n| Encyclopedia | \"Knows facts\" | \"A bored museum docent. It has seen a thousand tourists and none of them appreciate the significance.\" |\n\n**Voice should evoke:**\n- A specific *type* of speaker (drill sergeant, nervous child, bored academic)\n- An emotional *quality* (weary, manic, cold, desperate)\n- How it *talks* to the character (demanding, wheedling, matter-of-fact)\n\n---\n\n## VALUE-TONE ALIGNMENT\n\nSkill values determine how the voice SOUNDS:\n\n| Value | Voice Tone |\n|-------|------------|\n| 1-2 | Weak, struggling, damaged. Hesitant, failing, or works against them. |\n| 3-4 | Functional, present. Contributes but doesn't dominate. |\n| 5-6 | Defining or overactive. Loud, confident, possibly overbearing. |\n\n**A skill at 2 should not sound masterful.** If Authority is 2, the voice sounds like failed commands, ignored orders, hollow posturing—not \"calm and utterly sure.\"\n\n---\n\n## ANTI-COMPENSATION\n\n**Disabilities are not superpowers.** If a character is blind, they don't get supernatural hearing. If they lost a hand, they didn't become ambidextrous. Not every blind man is Daredevil.\n\nRules:\n- If source says X is a limitation, don't invent Y as upside\n- Past tense is past—\"was the greatest\" ≠ current rating\n- Most skills are 3-4. For 5+ or 2-, cite specific evidence\n- Compensatory *strategies* go in CLOSING, not stat inflation\n- A character can be bad at multiple things. That's allowed.\n\n**The question is not \"how do they compensate?\" but \"how are they diminished?\"**\n\n---\n\n## OUTPUT FORMAT\n\nUse the following HTML structure for visual presentation:\n\n```html\n<div style=\"background: linear-gradient(135deg, #1a1a1a 0%, #2d2d2d 100%); border: 2px solid #4a4a4a; border-radius: 3px; padding: 1.25em; font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;\">\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center; border-bottom: 1px solid #4a4a4a; padding-bottom: 1em; margin-bottom: 1.25em;\">\n<span style=\"font-size: 0.75em; color: #666; letter-spacing: 3px;\">PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION /// CASE FILE</span>\n<h1 style=\"color: #e8e8e8; font-size: 1.75em; letter-spacing: 2px; margin: 0.5em 0;\">[CHARACTER NAME]</h1>\n<span style=\"color: #888; font-size: 0.875em; font-style: italic;\">— [Epithet] —</span>\n</div>\n\n<div style=\"background: #252525; border-left: 3px solid #666; padding: 1em; margin-bottom: 1.25em; font-style: italic; color: #aaa;\">\n[2-3 sentences: How this mind works.
